# Kali
## Everything Kali. This repo generates a Docker image that actually contains all the tools, as well as the spec for running a Kali codespace.

Want to get running quickly? Create a new codespace on the top right. This will use the built image from this repository. 

We're building `rreichel3/kali-fully-loaded` in this repo. Check it out on DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/rreichel3/kali-fully-loaded). We rebuild the image daily.
